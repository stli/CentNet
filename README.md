# CentNet
Author: Steffen Limmer steffen.limmer@tu-berlin.de

Matlab code to compute volume and centroid of intersection polytopes for sparse recovery of simplex valued signals. The code was used to simulate the proposed Laplace transform techniques. Note: numerical instabilities may occur for larger input dimensions.
